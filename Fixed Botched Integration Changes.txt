Steps to Install
1) copy 310-crossroads-main directory (Root of main branch) to htdocs to create htdocs\310-crossroads-main
2) create a database named  cs_310_final_project
3) Go to Import and select c:\xampp\htdocs\310-crossroads-main\backend_crossroads\cs_310_final_project.sql
4) Launch browser & navigate to http://localhost/310-crossroads-main



Problems:
1) Need everyone on the same database.  Pick one merger code to that DB
	crossroads
	CS_310_final_project
2) Need everone to use relative pathing or the same absolute path
	http://localhost/CS_310_DEMO/admin_acc/
	http://localhost/crossroads/orders


Changes needed to integrate properly:
1) Moved to Standard DBName - CS_310_final_project   (could have used either, modified the crossroads.sql since they did not provide one)
		crossroads, crossroadsgroup23, cs_310_final_project
	a) updated crossroads.sql to cs_310_final_project.sql and replace the dbname
	b) search and replace all connection strings to use cs_310_final_project across all code modules
2) They used the wrong starting location for the frontend code.  
	a) Moved code in frontend_crossroads which should have been the home of the front_end to the root which was used as home of front_end
	b) search an replace frontend_crossroads where they added it, to eliminate it.
	c) 
3) People hardcoded differnt assumed home directories for the frontend
	a) search and replace http://localhost/CSCE310/310-crossroads ==> http://localhost/310-crossroads-main
	b) search and replace http://localhost/crossroads ==> http://localhost/310-crossroads-main
4) mismatched home pages:  home.php includes home2.html while main home is really home.html
	a) changed home.php to include home.html not home2.html
	b) changed home.html to use absolute addressing to avoid all the differnt assumptions about directory structure
	c) changed home.html to go to home.php so the delete account function is available after the first time
	d) fixed account.php to include home.html instead of home2.html
	e) fixed login.php to include home.html 
	d) delete.php,login.php returns to http://localhost/310-crossroads-main/home.php instead of ../home.html
5) account management assumes frontend_crossroads directory, fixed to run without frontend_crossroads
6) The login.php they used is outdated switch to login.php in frontend_crossroads
7) review code table structure had only 1 account_id not account_ID-buyer and account_ID_seller  and only review_text not review_title and review_body.  changed table structure to match code.
    	From:
	  CREATE TABLE `reviews` (
		`review_id` int(12) NOT NULL,
		`account_id_seller` int(12) NOT NULL,
		`account_id_buyer` int(12) NOT NULL,
		`item_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
		`review_score` int(2) NOT NULL,
		`review_title` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
		`review_text` varchar(255) NOT NULL	
	  )
	To:
	  CREATE TABLE `reviews` (
		`review_id` int(12) NOT NULL,
		`account_id` int(12) NOT NULL,
		`item_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
		`review_score` int(2) NOT NULL,
		`review_title` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
		`review_text` varchar(255) NOT NULL
	  )
	and:
	  
	  

8) review section code pages used account_ID and review_ID instead of account_id and review_id.  Search and replace account_ID to account_id.
9) Their modification to database creation SQL has failed alter table commands:
ALTER TABLE `item_list`
  ADD CONSTRAINT `FK_ItemBeingPurchased` FOREIGN KEY (`item_id`) REFERENCES `item` (`item_id`),
  ADD CONSTRAINT `FK_OrderOfItem` FOREIGN KEY (`order_id`) REFERENCES `orders` (`order_id`);
#1452 - Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails (`cs_310_final_project`.`#sql-b1ac_c2`, CONSTRAINT `FK_OrderOfItem` FOREIGN KEY (`order_id`) REFERENCES `orders` (`order_id`))

Fixed by adding an order to orders with order_id = 5
10) Changed access_orders to test for existance of id passed in on URL to eliminate error messages when not passed.
    //    if($row['order_id'] == $_GET['id']) {
    if (isset($_GET['id']) && $row['order_id'] == $_GET['id']) {
11) When you delete an order, you have to delete the item_list for that order .  they added a constraint that suddenly enforced that.
	a) Added:	$sql = "DELETE FROM item_list WHERE order_id=$id";
			$conn->query($sql);
	   before:
			$sql = "DELETE FROM orders WHERE order_id=$id";
			$conn->query($sql);
12) No link to register.php :  Added following to login.php before "return home"
	    <a href="register.php">Register as new User</a><br>
13) Register new user register user with account_ID of zero. It also registers it with an account_type of zero which anly allows admins to register. This vido shows account type being set to null, so this is not an integration issue.
	Coiuld fix by making account.account_id auto_incrementing or copying the method catherine used to get max and add 1 (race condition possible there though I believe if there were muliplt servers running)
      and and 2nd part by adding account_type to the insert statement
	* Did above as temp fix to avoid invalidaing db
	      $max_id_query = mysqli_query($connection, "SELECT max(account_id) FROM account");
      	$max_id = mysqli_fetch_array($max_id_query)[0];
	      $max_id++;
      	$query = "INSERT INTO account (account_id, account_fname, account_lname, account_email, account_password,account_type) 
            	    VALUES('$max_id', '$account_fname', '$account_lname', '$account_email', '$password_1','2')";
      mysqli_query($connection, $query);

14) register.php was missing extra session variables added to login.php
15) delete.php was missing quotes around $id in the sql
		$sql = "DELETE FROM account WHERE account_id = '$id';";
16) Integration deleted the logout link in the main navigation si it was reentered.


Look into:  
1) {root}/navbar.html is included from many places, but uses relative addresses.  need to fix to be based on root of wherever the code is installed.   You should be able to move/rename the root without breaking the code.
2) You are missing 2 foreign key constraints on orders vs account and address tables.  You should not be able to delete an account if there are orders for that account.  
	a) Should not be able to add an order for a non-existant account.  Your UI needs to gracefully handle when the order is not allowed to be created  (ie give list of accounts in dropdown)
		ALTER TABLE `orders` ADD CONSTRAINT `FK_orders_account` FOREIGN KEY (`account_id`) REFERENCES `account`(`account_id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE RESTRICT; 
	b) Should not be able to add an order for a non-existant address.  Your UI needs to gracefully handle when the order is not allowed to be created  (ie give list of addresses in dropdown)
		ALTER TABLE `orders` ADD CONSTRAINT `FK_orders_address` FOREIGN KEY (`address_id`) REFERENCES `address`(`address_id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE RESTRICT;
	c) Should not be able to add an order for a non-existant address.  Your UI needs to gracefully handle when the order is not allowed to be created  (ie give list of addresses in dropdown)
		ALTER TABLE `orders` ADD CONSTRAINT `FK_orders_address` FOREIGN KEY (`address_id`) REFERENCES `address`(`address_id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE RESTRICT;
	d) Handle this gracefully by replacing int input with dropdown list populated with allowed values
       	in add_order.php , Replace 
			<label for="buyerID" <?php if(!$_SESSION['is_admin']) {echo " style='display: none'";}?>>Buyer's Account ID:</label>
			<input type="number" name="buyerID" <?php if(!$_SESSION['is_admin']) {echo " style='display: none'";}?>>
		with
			<label for="buyerID"<?php if (!$_SESSION['is_admin']) echo " style='display:none;'"; ?>>Buyer's Account ID:</label>
			<?php
			if ($_SESSION['is_admin']) {
				echo '<select name="buyerID">';
				$query = "SELECT account_id FROM account";
				$result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);
				while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {
					echo '<option value="' . $row['account_id'] . '">' . $row['account_id'] . '</option>';
				}
				echo '</select>';
			} else {
				echo '<input type="number" name="buyerID" style="display:none;">';
			}
			?>
	e) 	in add_order.php , Replace 
				<input type="number" name="addressID">
		with
			<label for="buyerID"<?php if (!$_SESSION['is_admin']) echo " style='display:none;'"; ?>>Buyer's Account ID:</label>
			<?php
			if ($_SESSION['is_admin']) {
				echo '<select name="buyerID">';
				$query = "SELECT account_id FROM account";
				$result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);
				while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {
					echo '<option value="' . $row['account_id'] . '">' . $row['account_id'] . '</option>';
				}
				echo '</select>';
			} else {
				echo '<input type="number" name="buyerID" style="display:none;">';
			}
			?>
